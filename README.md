To install PictureCharacter, download the `picture-character-v1.0.deb` file from the releases page and copy this into the terminal

    sudo dpkg -i picture-character-v1.0.deb
To run it type:

    pic-character
It should open with a message in red in the centre of the screen. Drag your image to the area and you should be able to see your character. It works best with transparent PNG images. You can use GIMP to remove the background of the image.
